* Credits
I'll be gradually adding some of the sources I got inspiration or hints from about how to build my own configuration:
- [[https://github.com/freetonik/emacs-dotfiles/blob/master/init.pdf][Rakhim Davletkaliyev's configuration]]
  
* Configurations

** Use package

Initialize =package= and add sources:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(let* ((no-ssl (and (memq system-type '(windows-nt ms-dos))
		    (not (gnutls-available-p))))
       (proto (if no-ssl "http" "https")))
  (when no-ssl
    (warn "\
Your version of Emacs does not support SSL connections,
which is unsafe because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks.
There are two things you can do about this warning:
1. Install an Emacs version that does support SSL and be safe.
2. Remove this warning from your init file so you won't see it again."))
  ;; Comment/uncomment these two lines to enable/disable MELPA and MELPA Stable as desired
  (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa" (concat proto "://melpa.org/packages/")) t)
  ;; (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa-stable" (concat proto "://stable.melpa.org/packages/")) t)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "org" (concat proto "://orgmode.org/elpa/")) t)
  (when (< emacs-major-version 24)
    ;; For important compatibility libraries like cl-lib
    (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "gnu" (concat proto "://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))))
(package-initialize)
#+END_SRC emacs-lisp

Install =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))

(eval-when-compile (require 'use-package))

(setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+END_SRC
